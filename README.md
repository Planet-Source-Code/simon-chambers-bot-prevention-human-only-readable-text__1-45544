### Description

An interesting and simple program to demonstrated how bot prevention pictures are made (like the vote one on this site ;-) ). Also included is a new feature that would further confuse any OCR program. I have included extensive comments to try and make it as clear as possible on what’s happening.
 
### More Info
 
I’m not sure if this technique is patented or not, so if it is please contact me ASAP by email at: sic_uk@yahoo.co.uk. Because of this I have not made it executable by a web page script, however if it is not patented I will create another program for use in a web page!

If you find it useful or rubbish, please be courteous and vote+comment please!
