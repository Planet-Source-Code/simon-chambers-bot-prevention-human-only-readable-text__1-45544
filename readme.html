An interesting and simple program to demonstrated how bot prevention pictures are made (like the vote one on this site ;-) ). Also included is a new feature that would further confuse any OCR program. I have included extensive comments to try and make it as clear as possible on what’s happening.

I’m not sure if this technique is patented or not, so if it is please contact me ASAP by email at: <a href="mailto:sic_uk@yahoo.co.uk">sic_uk@yahoo.co.uk</a>. Because of this I have not made it executable by a web page script, however if it is not patented I will create another program for use in a web page!
<br><br>

If you find it useful or rubbish, please be courteous and vote+comment please!

P.S. All of the code is written by me.
